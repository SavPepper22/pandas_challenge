# Pandas_challenge
Here is my submission for the Module 4 Pandas assignment. In this assignment I made the calculations of a city's school district and analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I used the web application Jupyter Notebook and the open-source framework Pandas to work on the tabular data of the many rows and columns. I was able to make dataframes using the data given that showed the school's overall passing grades, school size, school name, school type, school budget, and budget per student. I made a dataframes of the District Summary, School Summary, Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, Scores by School Type. After making all the tables I was able to write an analysis of my findings and placed the report at the at the top. So I did my coding on the SSPyCitySchools.ipynb because I wanted to look at the PyCitySchools.ipynb data so I knew what my results should look like.
